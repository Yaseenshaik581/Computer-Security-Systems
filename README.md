# Computer-Security-Systems
This project addresses the issue of developing an Admin Login Management System which increases the security features. It is being developed in PHP, MySQL and XAMPP and is handling everything such as making sure users can log in safely, user management, password resets, and strong session management. The central premise is to identify the vices of the outdated systems such as leaving passwords in plain text or lack of an option to reset it and to show how intelligent use can wipe away those ills.

The main objectives of the system are:
• To achieve user authentication by hash password and input validation.
• To implement powerful password policies and avoid weak credentials. To have reliable session management and logout.
• To have password recovery mechanism by using reset tokens.
• To provide administrators with capability to manage users (add, edit, delete).
